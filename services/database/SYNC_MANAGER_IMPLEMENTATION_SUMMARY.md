# Sync Manager with Conflict Resolution - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Sync Manager with conflict resolution has been successfully implemented as part of the data preservation enhancement. This component handles bidirectional synchronization between localStorage and PostgreSQL database, with intelligent conflict detection and resolution mechanisms.

## Key Components

### 1. SyncService (`syncService.ts`)
The main synchronization service that coordinates all sync operations:

- **syncWithDatabase()**: Main method that synchronizes queued operations from localStorage to the database
- **detectConflicts()**: Detects conflicts between localStorage and database data based on version numbers
- **mergeReminderConflict()**: Resolves conflicts by comparing timestamps and merging changes appropriately
- **pullRemoteChanges()**: Pulls changes from the database to update localStorage

### 2. FallbackManager (`fallbackManager.ts`)
Manages the localStorage fallback system and operation queuing:

- **queueOperation()**: Queues operations when in fallback mode
- **dequeueReadyOperations()**: Retrieves operations ready for synchronization
- **completeOperations()**: Removes successfully synchronized operations
- **getStoredReminders()**: Retrieves reminders stored in localStorage
- **updateStoredReminder()**: Updates a reminder in localStorage
- **getLastSyncTimestamp()**: Gets the timestamp of the last successful sync
- **updateLastSyncTimestamp()**: Updates the last sync timestamp

### 3. RemindersRepository (`RemindersRepository.ts`)
Database repository with conflict resolution support:

- **updateReminderWithVersion()**: Updates a reminder using optimistic concurrency control
- **getReminderRaw()**: Retrieves raw reminder data from the database

### 4. Database Schema (`006_conflict_version_and_indexes.sql`)
Database migration that adds versioning support:

- Adds `version` column to reminders table for optimistic concurrency
- Creates indexes for improved sync performance

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

### 1. Optimistic Concurrency Control
- Each reminder has a `version` field that increments with each update
- When updating, the system checks if the expected version matches the current database version
- If versions don't match, a conflict is detected

### 2. Conflict Detection
- Compares versions of reminders in localStorage and database
- Identifies conflicts when versions differ for the same reminder

### 3. Conflict Resolution
- Compares timestamps to determine which version is newer
- If local version is newer, local changes are preferred
- If remote version is newer, remote changes are preferred but local changes are merged
- Version number is incremented after resolution

## Features Implemented

1. **Bidirectional Synchronization**
   - Push changes from localStorage to database
   - Pull changes from database to localStorage
   - Automatic synchronization when connection is restored

2. **Conflict Detection**
   - Version-based conflict detection
   - Timestamp comparison for conflict resolution

3. **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**
   - Automatic merging of non-conflicting changes
   - Timestamp-based resolution strategy
   - Version incrementing after resolution

4. **Queue Management**
   - Operation queuing during offline mode
   - Exponential backoff for failed operations
   - Status tracking for each operation

5. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of sync failures
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Detailed error logging

## Testing

Unit tests have been created to verify the functionality:
- `syncService.test.ts`: Tests for the SyncService class
- `fallbackManager.test.ts`: Tests for the FallbackManager class

## Integration

The Sync Manager integrates with:
- Database service for PostgreSQL operations
- Fallback manager for localStorage operations
- Repositories for data access
- Logger for detailed logging

## Usage

The Sync Manager automatically handles synchronization when:
1. The application enters fallback mode due to database connectivity issues
2. The database connection is restored
3. Manual synchronization is triggered

## Conclusion

The Sync Manager with conflict resolution has been successfully implemented and provides robust synchronization capabilities with intelligent conflict detection and resolution. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the design document and handles all the acceptance criteria for Requirement 5.
